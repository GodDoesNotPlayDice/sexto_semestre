**1. Can you recognize the hooks?**

- The hook is a statement or question designed to capture the reader’s attention.
    - In the **first text** (about "Ambient Assisted Living"), the hook is the description of how smart environments make life easier by detecting user needs and responding in real-time.
    - In the **second text** (about the restaurant clustering algorithm), the hook is the idea of using data to recommend restaurants, which is practical and relevant to everyday use.
    - In the **third text** (WeightWatcher app), the hook highlights the relevance of weight control applications in modern society, which connects with people's health concerns.

**2. Do you understand the background information?**

- Background information helps to provide context for the reader.
    - The **first text** gives background about pervasive computing and its application in smart homes, focusing on user activity monitoring.
    - The **second text** provides technical details about how the algorithm processes data from websites, focusing on clustering techniques.
    - The **third text** gives background on health problems related to weight control, discussing how the app can assist with managing weight through daily activities and exercises.

**3. Can you identify the statement or main points?**

- The statement is the clear purpose or main point of the project.
    - The **first text's main point** is the application of smart environments for monitoring health-related activities.
    - The **second text’s main point** is the development of a clustering algorithm to suggest restaurants based on extracted web data.
    - The **third text’s main point** is the development of an application to help users monitor and control their weight through a mobile platform.
